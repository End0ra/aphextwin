    <p class="im-text1">Aphex Twin, whose real name is Richard D. James, was born in Ireland and raised in Cornwall, England. His adopted name was taken from a brand of audio equipment, Aphex Systems Limited, and "Twin" is in memory of his older brother who died at birth, who was also named Richard James.</p>
    <p class="im-text2">He once wore his 'Come To Daddy' silicone mask in bed to scare his girlfriend. He put the cover over himself, then cuddled up to her and waited until she turned around. He also remixed a Craig David track just to irritate him, calling it a "total aggro thingâ€¦just to mess with him".</p>
    <p class="im-text3">Aphex Twin is into Gabba, has his own record label, enjoys chess, and is very clear that the merging of audio and visual is essential.</p>
    <p class="im-text4">In addition to his musical talents, Aphex Twin is also known for his visual artistry. He has directed several of his own music videos under the pseudonym "Chris Cunningham," and his visual style is as distinctive and unconventional as his music.</p>
